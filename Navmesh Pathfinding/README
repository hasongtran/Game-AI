SUBMISSIONS BY: HA SONG TRAN
PARTNER: NATHANIEL SURIAWIJAYA

Implemented in Python a bidirectional A* search algorithm to solve the problem of finding paths in navmeshes 
created from user-provided images.

Submissions Contains:

p2_pathfinder.py - implementation of find_path
test_image.png - colorized image of banana slug
test_image.png.mesh.pickle - mesh pickle of banana slug

Did not quite get to bidirectional A*, but everything else should be there.

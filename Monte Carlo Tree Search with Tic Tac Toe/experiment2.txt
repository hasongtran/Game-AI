Experiment 2

Analysis:

Heuristic vs vanilla

10 nodes:
  wins: 71
  losses: 25
  ties: 4

100 nodes:
  wins: 82
  losses: 13
  ties: 5

1000 nodes:
  wins: 85
  losses: 15
  ties: 0

From the results from testing 3 different amount of nodes per tree, we can see that
heuristic consistently beats out vanilla. Furthermore, the higher the nodes per tree
values are, the higher the chance of winning is. However, there doesn't seem to be
much of a difference between 100 nodes and 1000 nodes to a tree, but there is a big
difference between raising from 10 nodes to either 100 nodes or 1000 nodes.

Experiment 1

Analysis:

Vanilla vs vanilla2

10 nodes:
  wins: 60
  losses: 32
  ties: 4

100 nodes:
  wins: 49	
  losses: 47
  ties: 4

500 nodes:
  wins: 72	
  losses: 28
  ties: 5


1000 nodes:
  wins: 85
  losses: 15
  ties: 0

 - mcts_vanilla2 will always perform at a fixed rate of 100 nodes/tree
 - mcts_vanilla will test against mcts_vanilla2 4 times, each time with different
   a different amount of nodes
 - Each variation of nodes will be ran over 100 games

Result:
 - We tested 2 different versions of the code. One returning the node with the best
   UCB and the other returning the nodes with the best win rates.
 - For UCB's result, it appears that lesser amount of nodes/tree wins more than
   the higher amount of nodes/tree. However, the difference is not enough for it
   to be counted as significant.
 - For the best win rate's result, mcts appears to be performing better than when we
   tested UCB. Attributing more nodes to the tree also increased the chance of winning.
   The tie rate is also much lower than when we tested with best rate.
 - Note that the graph we show and the code submitted is using win rates.
